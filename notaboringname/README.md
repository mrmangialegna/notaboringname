In this part I start to break down the major project into smaller chunks. 

This is the first one.

The fragmentation aims to show how to structure and discipline the creation of a larger project into small operative units â€” a procedure known in PM as Milestones, and in Agile practice as Sprints.

Therefore, I begin with the first step: creating a simple backend Python/Flask web app with a frontend in Java/HTML/Css that responds to an HTTP/REST request, to implement in a future structure.
